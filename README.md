# Quadcopter_SimulinkGAZEBO

## Contents
This repository contains simulation code to control a Quadcopter using ROS/Gazebo. This is done by sending ROS topics from Simulink, using blocks from blocks from from ROS toolbox. To control the drone following architecture of Simulink/Gazebo is implemented:

For the moment, these models control the drone with ID 1, but you can change the topics of the Subscribe and Publish blocks to control another drone.
## Tested dependencies of the model
The simulation is tested to be working on the following dependencies:
1) ROS Kinetic
2) GAZEBO 7 
3) Ubuntu 16.04.7 LTS 
4) Vmware workstation 16 player(Hihgly recommeded for connection with MATLAB
# Installing dependencies
1) ROS Kinetic

          http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu            
            
2) Gazebo 7

                sudo apt-get install gazebo7
3) UBUNTU 16.04.7 LTS

              https://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/
              
4) Vmware workstation 16 player

        https://www.vmware.com/in/products/workstation-player.html


## Setting up the model
Quick install and run process(ROS side; Using Bash)
1) If not done make scripts executable: chmod +x setup.sh chmod +x run_gzb.sh chmod +x start_uav.sh

2) Run setup script (this should be done once for a fresh install without ROS or gazebo alreaded installed, in case of error run required commands by hand step by step) ./setup.sh

3) Start gazebo environment simulator and ROS server ./run_gzb.sh

4) Add a robot to the scene with default ID ./start_uav.sh

To connect Simulink with the ROS server, follow these steps:

1) In MATLAB, execute the rosinit function with the IP of the virtual machine
2) In Simulink, navigate to Tools > Robotics Operating System > Configure Network Addresses
3) In ROS Master, make sure Network Address is set to Default
4) In Node Host, make sure Network Address is set to Default
5) Test the connectivity using the Test button


# Notes 
1) If a model can control the drone but does not receive any data from the drone:
    a)  Make sure you have set the ROS_IP environment variable in the VM before running ROS
    b)  See if the port on VM is listening
