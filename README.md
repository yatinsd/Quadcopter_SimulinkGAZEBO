# Quadcopter_SimulinkGAZEBO

## Description
This repository contains simulation code to control a Quadcopter using ROS/Gazebo. This is done by sending ROS topics from Simulink, using blocks from blocks from from ROS toolbox. To control the drone following architecture of Simulink/Gazebo is implemented:
